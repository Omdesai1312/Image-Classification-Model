This project is a sports person classifier that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify different sports figures from images. The model is trained on a dataset of images and uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to make predictions.

#### **Technologies Used**

`opencv-python` (OpenCV):** Used for computer vision tasks such as image processing, face detection, and eye detection using pre-trained Haar Cascades.
`numpy`:** Essential for numerical operations, especially for handling image data as arrays.
`matplotlib`:** Used for visualizing images and plotting the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
`scikit-learn`:** Provides the machine learning tools, including the `SVC` for classification, `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics like the classification report and confusion matrix.
`joblib`:** Used to save and load the trained machine learning model (`saved_model.pkl`).
`json`:** Used to save the class dictionary that maps class names to numerical labels (`class_dictionary.json`).

#### **Methodology**

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline for image classification:

1.  **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:**
    * The notebook reads images from a local dataset. An example image from the "Ma_Long" directory is loaded.
    * It uses OpenCV's Haar Cascades to detect and crop faces and eyes from the images.
    * Processed images are resized to a uniform size (32x32 pixels).
    * A combination of the cropped face and both eyes is used to form a single feature vector using `np.hstack`.

2.  **Model Training:**
    * The model uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a `rbf` (Radial Basis Function) kernel.
    * `GridSearchCV` is used to find the best hyperparameters for the SVC, which helps in optimizing the model's accuracy.

3.  **Evaluation:**
    * The model's performance is evaluated using a **classification report**, which provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
    * A **confusion matrix** is generated to visualize the model's predictions against the actual labels.

4.  **Model Persistence:**
    * After training, the best-performing model (`best_clf`) is saved to a file named `saved_model.pkl` using `joblib`.
    * The dictionary mapping class names (e.g., 'lionel_messi') to numerical labels is saved to a file named `class_dictionary.json` using `json`.

#### **How to Run the Project**

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required libraries installed. The notebook shows using `pip install opencv-python`. You will also need `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.
2.  **Dataset:** Place your image dataset in a directory with subfolders for each class (e.g., a folder named `dataset` with subfolders for each sports person).
3.  **Run the Notebook:** Execute the `Sports_CLassfication_Project.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment. The code will handle data loading, training, and evaluation.
4.  **Use the Saved Model:** You can use the `saved_model.pkl` and `class_dictionary.json` files to make predictions on new images without retraining the model.
